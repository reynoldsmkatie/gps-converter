### Description:
I enjoy hiking in our beautiful national parks and forests, but many of these areas don't have any cell reception or WiFi. I wear a GPS watch that can navigate to any GPS coordinates I input even without service, as long as the coordinates are in DMS format (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds). Example: 47°29'32.6"N 120°49'59.3"W.

However, Google Maps favors the DD coordinate format. Example: 47.492400993416226, -120.83314130544642. It takes a few clunky steps to convert these coordinates to DMS format, so I created this DD to DMS GPS Coordinates Converter using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I even enabled it as a web app for mobile, so I can add to my homescreen and use it as an app—even if I'm offline or have no service!
